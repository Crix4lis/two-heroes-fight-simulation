# two-heroes-fight-simulation
This repository contains solution(s) to given task (below in this file) approached in different ways.
Each approach (that is finished) has its own branch and own tag. Application is runnable form cli.

## How to run
1. Run docer: `docker-compose up -d`
    - run application: `docker-compose exec cli php run.php`
    - run unit tests `docker-compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit tests/`

## TASK
Create battle simulation between Orderus and beast. Each time when battle starts, beast and Orderus
are generated with different statistics that follow following rules:
- Orderus:
    - Health: 70 - 100
    - Strength: 70 - 80
    - Defence: 45 â€“ 55
    - Speed: 40 â€“ 50
    - Luck: 10% - 30% (0% means no luck, 100% lucky all the time)
    - additional skills:
        - Rapid strike: Strike twice while itâ€™s his turn to attack; thereâ€™s a 10% chance
        heâ€™ll use this skill every time he attacks
        - Magic shield: Takes only half of the usual damage when an enemy attacks;
        thereâ€™s a 20% change heâ€™ll use this skill every time he defends
- Beast:
    - Health: 60 - 90
    - Strength: 60 - 90
    - Defence: 40 â€“ 60
    - Speed: 40 â€“ 60
    - Luck: 25% - 40%

Gameplay rules:
- First attack is done by the player with the higher speed. If both players have
   the same speed, than the attack is carried on by the player with the highest luck.
- After an attack, the players switch roles: the attacker now defends and the
   defender now attacks.
- The damage done by the attacker is calculated with the following formula:
   `Damage = Attacker strength â€“ Defender defence`
- The damage is subtracted from the defenderâ€™s health. An attacker can miss their
hit and do no damage if the defender gets lucky that turn.
- Orderusâ€™ skills occur randomly, based on their chances, so take them into
account on each turn.
- Game ends when one of the players remain without health or the number of
turns reaches 20.
- The application must output the results each turn: what
happened, which skills were used (if any), the damage done, defenderâ€™s health
left.
- If we have a winner before the maximum number of rounds is reached, he must
be declared.

## WORD OF EXPLANATION
The easiest and most 'web app' solution would be to use some external or self made
event bus but I just want to play with Design Patterns (I might add that solution someday).

### TODO
- Forgot to implement miss ability... ðŸ’©
- Fix non existing delegation in MagicShield decorator
